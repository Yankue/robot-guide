# Custom Commands
Custom Commands are an easy way to add useful and niche features to RoBot for your server! They use slash commands like the rest of the bot, and can provide
some pretty advanced functionality. Want to manage roles of yourself, command users and other users? Or send custom messages from a custom slash command? Or
embed random numbers and arguments from the user? Custom commands is the answer to all of your problems!
