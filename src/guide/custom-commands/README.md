# Custom Commands
Custom Commands are an easy way to add useful and niche features to RoBot for your server! They use slash commands like the rest of the bot, and can provide some pretty advanced functionality. Want to manage roles of yourself, command users and other users? Or send custom messages from a custom slash command? Or embed random numbers and arguments from the user? Custom commands is the answer to all of your problems!

## Creating Custom Commands
To create a custom command, run `/config Custom Commands` in your server. This will start the custom command config menu in your DMs. To create a command, simply click the "Create Custom Command" button.

### Basic Information
First of all, you will need to give a name and description for your command. The name can be up to 32 characters long, and the description can be up to 80 characters long. They will be what your users see before they run the command.
:::tip
The description you enter will be prefixed by "RoBot Custom Command: ". Don't want this? Buy RoBot Premium to remove it.
