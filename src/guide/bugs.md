# Bugs
If you find a bug in RoBot, we ask you report it to a member of staff as soon as you can. You may test to check if the bug is 
reproduciable, but abusing/exploiting bugs is not acceptable.

### Reporting
You can either report it via `/post bug report` in our support server, or by messaging our developer Yankue#1296 (he has DMs open, so if 
you have a mutual server with him feel free to message without friending)
