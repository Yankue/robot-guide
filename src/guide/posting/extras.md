# Additional Features

## Logging

RoBot can log information in your specified channel regarding a post when an event has been fired. The log contains information like Post Author, Post ID and relevant information regarding the event. The logging feature is on a per-server basis and does not change per-category.

Here is the list of events:
* `Create` - Emits when a post has been created
* `Delete` - Emits when a post gets deleted(Emits only if the `delete` command is used)
* `Approved` - Emits when a post gets approved - Not applicable if post category does not have approval plugin enabled
* `Denied` - Emits when a post gets denied - Not applicable if post category does not have approval plugin enabled

If you want to enable logging for your post categories, run the following command in a Text Channel where RoBot has access to, replacing `<channel>` with the channel where posts should be logged:

```
>post_config logging_channel <channel>
```
