# Using Tickets
You will see in the ticket channel that there is an embed with buttons to manage the ticket. Use these buttons!

### To delete a ticket
First close it using the red button on the control panel in the pinned messages, you'll be prompted to enter a reason, but you can leave it blank. Then the control panel will change to have a button to delete the ticket - click this!

### To add other members to the ticket
Use `/ticketing add_member` and `/ticketing remove_member`
