# Core setup

Now we are into the exciting parts of the guide! The following instructions should help you setup the core settings required for RoBot to maximise RoBot's potential.

::: tip
Please make sure RoBot has `ADMINISTRATOR` permissions in your server, problems may arise if you do not have it enabled!
:::

## Configuration
By default, RoBot's core features are ready to go, however features like posting and tickets require extra configuration which is explained later in this guide. By default, some permissions are set for RoBot's moderation and configuration commands. To give users permission that don't already have permission to use a command, or to disable a command, go to server settings > integrations > RoBot > then click a command and manage the roles and/or channels that are permitted to use it.
