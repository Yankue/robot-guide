### Migration to Slash Commands
RoBot has now started moving to slash commands, and now has this fancy guide!

Posting, tickets, fun, roblox, two step verify, info, utility and more are all now running on slash commands and interactions. Some of the commands may be slash command exclusive, but some of the most used commands still work in the original way as well as with the new slash commands, to help to provide an easier switch for your users.
